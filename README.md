# LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ðŸ“š
A Library Management System is a software built to handle the primary housekeeping functions of a library. Libraries rely on library management systems to manage asset collections as well as relationships with their members. Library management systems help libraries keep track of the books and their checkouts, as well as membersâ€™ subscriptions and profiles. Library management systems also involve maintaining the database for entering new books and recording books that have been borrowed with their respective due dates. I have created a CLI (Command Line Interface) based Library Management System using python and csv files.

# Modules Used
1. datetime : Python Datetime module supplies classes to work with date and time. These classes provide a number of functions to deal with dates, times and time intervals.
2. os : This module provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality.
3. csv : TheÂ csv module implements classes to read and write tabular data in CSV format.
4. hashlib : This module implements a common interface to many different secure hash and message digest algorithms like SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512.
5. getpass : It prompts the user for a password without echoing. The getpass module provides a secure way to handle the password prompts where programs interact with the users via the terminal.

# Setup
1. Clone the script

        git clone https://github.com/nakshatra-malhotra/library-management-system.git

2. In the file `librarymanagementsystem.py` enter the SHA512 hash of your password.

2. Run the file `librarymanagementsystem.py`
